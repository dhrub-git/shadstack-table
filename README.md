# React + TypeScript + Vite + Shadcn + Tanstack Table v8

Demo: https://shadstack-table.vercel.app/

I was impressed by Shadcn's beautiful data table built with Tanstack,
but it lacked functionalities like virtualization, filtering, sorting,
and pinning. This motivated me to create my own generic data table that
could handle custom data and offer these essential features.

Not only did I need this functionality for my projects, but I also saw
it as an opportunity to improve my React skills. To ensure smooth
performance with large datasets, I implemented techniques like memoized
components and hooks. The table also includes persistent state management
through local and session storage, allowing users to maintain their preferred
view settings across sessions.
